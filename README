Simple epoll chat
------------------

* chat_server
Command line options:
-p bind_port      The port on which the server listens to incoming connections from clients. 
                  This is required option to the start.
-d                To execute the server in the daemon mode. All errors when the server starts are 
                  redirected to the syslog.
-f                To force close the running application instance if it exists. By default start of the 
                  second instance is completed with an error.
-l lock_file_dir  Set the directory to locate the lock file, that is used to prevent starting two 
                  application instance at the same time. The first running application instance locks 
                  the file and will unlock it only after the completion. The second instance 
                  does not lock file again and starts, if at this time the first instance is running. 
                  By default the directory is /tmp/.

The server may connect up to 10 clients.


* chat_client
Command line options:
server_ip         The server's IP address to connect. 
server_port       The server port to connect. 
Both options are required to the start.

After connection to the server you can just write text to the stdin and send the text by Enter. 
Incoming messages are printed above. The nick names are generated by the server. To exit from the 
chat press Ctrl+D or Ctrl+C.
